It follows rules called REST (Representational State Transfer), which make sure everything is organized and predictable. You use simple HTTP methods like GET to fetch data, POST to send new data, PUT to update, and DELETE to remove. It’s clean, stateless, and usually speaks in JSON."

It’s popular because it’s simple to start with, flexible to grow, and doesn’t force you into a specific structure. You can build anything from a tiny app to a big project, and it plays nicely with extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy or Flask-RESTful."
